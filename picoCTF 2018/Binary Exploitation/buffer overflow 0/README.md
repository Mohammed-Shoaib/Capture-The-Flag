# buffer overflow 0

## Problem

Let's start off simple, can you overflow the right buffer in this [program](https://2018shell.picoctf.com/static/3149816cf3615fa68f99af3cd667d6b9/vuln) to get the flag? You can also find it in /problems/buffer-overflow-0_4_ab1efebbee9446039487c64b88d38631 on the shell server. [Source](https://2018shell.picoctf.com/static/3149816cf3615fa68f99af3cd667d6b9/vuln.c).

### Hint

How can you trigger the flag to print?

If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters. Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.
