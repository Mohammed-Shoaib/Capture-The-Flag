## Problem

Can you authenticate to this [service](https://2018shell.picoctf.com/static/0bb8663a6d82ba0c5d07f06e357c22ca/auth) and get the flag? Connect with `nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 31045`. [Source](https://2018shell.picoctf.com/static/0bb8663a6d82ba0c5d07f06e357c22ca/auth.c).

Are all the system calls being used safely?
