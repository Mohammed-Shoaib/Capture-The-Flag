# Forensics Warmup 2

## Problem

Hmm for some reason I can't open this [PNG](https://2018shell.picoctf.com/static/b96c236db4c32ed47e9958c7e461b3c4/flag.png)? Any ideas?

### Hint

How do operating systems know what kind of file it is? (It's not just the ending!)

Make sure to submit the flag as picoCTF{XXXXX}
