# grep 1

## Problem

Can you find the flag in [file](https://2018shell.picoctf.com/static/f2e1fdcd5c405ca4170af1a8973b365b/file)? This would be really obnoxious to look through by hand, see if you can find a faster way. You can also find the file in /problems/grep-1_4_0431431e36a950543a85426d0299343e on the shell server.
